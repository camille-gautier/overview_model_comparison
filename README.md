Currently, MESH, SUMMA and FUSE are implemented. 

Two examples are provided: the BEAVERBANK RIVER NEAR KINSAC (01DG003) and the HAY RIVER NEAR HAY RIVER (07OB001). 
The first example handles the results for a lumped model at the outlet and the second example presents an upstream subcatchment. 
The streamflow timeserie will only be output for the outlet. 

The script _install_package.R aims to install all the libraries to run the overview script.
